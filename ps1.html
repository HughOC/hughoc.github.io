									This is the second problem set of the course entitled Introduction to Computer Science
									 and Programming in Python. The first part of the problem involved making a calculator 
									 for how many months it would take you to save enough money for a down payment on a house, 
									 based on your salary, the price of the house and how much you are willing to save each month. 
									 We were asked to assume that the down payment would be 25% of the total cost of the house. 
									 We were also asked to assume that at the end of each month we make 0.33% interest on our savings.

                                <p>
										The second part of this problem set involved modifying the above calculator such that instead
										 of receiving a fixed salary, the user gets a raise every 6 months. The amount the raise is, 
										 is a question that the user has to answer.

								</p>

								<p>
										The last part of the problem sheet assumes that we want to finish saving 
										for our down payment in exactly 3 years. The calculator will then tell us 
										how much we will need to put away each month in order to achieve this. It is assumed 
										that that house costs $1,000,000 and that we get a raise of 0.07 each 6 months. In order 
										to solve this problem we use a bisection search, which means the computer guesses an amount to 
										save each month and then modifies this guess until it comes up with a total amount saved that is 
										close enough to how much we need for the down payment. In the case of this problem, we tell the computer 
										that the total amount saved must be within $100 of the down payment. If we never get to within $100
										of the downpayment, we terminate the code and tell the user that they don't earn enough to afford the down payment
										in 3 years.
