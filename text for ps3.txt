This is the third problem set for the MIT course entitled Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python.
For this problem set we had to make a Boggle-like game in Python. If you have never played Boggle, it is a
popular word game. You have a box which contains dice with a different letter on each face. First you have to shake the box
to see what letters you will be playing with. Then you must make as many words out these letters as possible.
